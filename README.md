# Method-Of-Averaging-and-Stability-Analysis
In this repository I have added all the code I used on my research on the Averaging Theory, where I, under Nidish Sir(IIT M) are trying to formulate a way in which we can use averaging theory to use it in checking the stability of non smooth systems where the classical floquet theory fails.
We have sucessfully implemented in few fold bifurcations using the first harmonic and the results are very good, analytically the real part of the eigen values of the averaged dynamics are the same as the floquet with an error of first order. I implemented this numerically and the results were matching the theory and Plotting the Poincarè map. The picture was more clear, the phase space iterated for time period T showed convergence of the points in the duffing oscillation, which matches it.

In this repository I have added the reports. You can learn about the theory from there (If you find any error, please let me know). I have aslo added the python and matlab codes used for analysis (please install the packages given above in the code).

The research is still onging at a very good pace and the repository is still under development.

I'm open to questions. Please contact me: yasht24@iiserb.ac.in I'll reach out.
